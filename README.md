# Heretic + Hexen ZScript

This project recreates EXDEFS and other proprietary resources from the Heretic+Hexen remaster so that the wads can be played in GZDoom based clients.

## Running
Instructions on how to run. First you will need a GZDoom client installed. You also need a copy of the Heretic + Hexen remaster.

Have the file locations of GZDoom, Heretic + Hexen, and the place you extrated this mod ready.
