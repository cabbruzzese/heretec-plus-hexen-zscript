# Heretic + Hexen ZScript

This project recreates EXDEFS and other proprietary resources from the Heretic+Hexen remaster so that the wads can be played in GZDoom based clients.

## Running
Instructions on how to run. First you will need a GZDoom client installed. You also need a copy of the Heretic + Hexen remaster.

Make note of the file locations for:
 - GZDoom
 - Heretic + Hexen
 - The directory you extracted this mod

### Hexen - Vestiges of Grandeur
1. To run, download the pk3.
2. Create a shortcut to GZDoom
3. Modify the shortcut to include `-iwad "c:\path-to-heretic-plus-hexen\hexen.wad" -file "c:\path-to-heretic-plus-hexen\hexen_vog.wad" -file "c:\extracted-path\hphbase.pk3"`

# Roadmap

This project is starting with VOG support for Hexen, and is about 5% complete for running through the expansion completely.

[🚧] - Vestiges of Grandeur support
[ ] - Deathkings EX support
[ ] - Hexen EX support
[ ] - Faith Renewed Support
[ ] - Heretic Ex support

Once complete, you can load GZDoom compatible mods (Zscript, Decorate, ACS, all map formats) side by side. Currently testing mod support with XRPG and HRPG. Once complete, I plan on additional mod testing.
